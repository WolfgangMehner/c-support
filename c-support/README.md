  *  CREDITS

C/C++-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably speed up writing code in
a consistent style. This is done by inserting complete statements, idioms,
comments, and code snippets. These code fragments are provided in an extendible
template library. Syntax checking, compiling, running a program, running indent
or code checkers can be done with a keystroke. There are many additional hints
and options which can improve speed and comfort when writing C/C++.
See the help file `csupport.txt` for more information.

This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.x.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
================================================================================

A system-wide installation for all users can also be done. This will have
further effects on how the plug-in works. For a step-by-step instruction, as
well as an explanation of the other consequences, please see the help file
`doc/csupport.txt` or look up the documentation via:

      :help csupport-system-wide


(1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `c-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/.vim/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/.vim/c-support/templates/Templates`
   if you have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive `c-support.zip` to `$HOME/.vim` and run

      unzip c-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/.vim/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/.vim/doc/...
      $HOME/.vim/plugin/c.vim

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/.vim/c-support/rc` as a starting point.

(1.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map `\ntw` inside a C/C++ buffer
   or the menu entry:

      C/C++ -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/.vim/templates/c.templates` to customize or add to your
   C/C++ template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or extensions
   for your `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of them. The files
   are documented.

(1.6) To enable additional tools, add these lines to your `$HOME/.vimrc`. To
   enable the CMake and Doxygen tools, use:

      let g:C_UseTool_cmake    = 'yes'
      let g:C_UseTool_doxygen  = 'yes'

   For enabling the Doxygen templates, see chapter 1.10.1 of the documentation:

      :help csupport-doxygen-enable


(2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `c-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/vimfiles/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/vimfiles/c-support/templates/Templates` if
   you have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive `c-support.zip` to `$HOME/vimfiles` and run

      unzip c-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/doc/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/c.vim

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/vimfiles/c-support/rc` as a starting point.

(2.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map `\ntw` inside a C/C++ buffer
   or the menu entry:

      C/C++ -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/vimfiles/templates/c.templates` to customize or add to
   your C/C++ template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or extensions
   for your `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of them. The files
   are documented.

(2.6) To enable additional tools, add these lines to your `$HOME/_vimrc`. To
   enable the CMake and Doxygen tools, use:

      let g:C_UseTool_cmake    = 'yes'
      let g:C_UseTool_doxygen  = 'yes'

   For enabling the Doxygen templates, see chapter 1.10.1 of the documentation:

      :help csupport-doxygen-enable

(2.7) Make sure the shell is set up correctly. The options `shell`,
   `shellcmdflag`, `shellquote`, and `shellxquote` must be set consistently.
   Compare `:help csupport-troubleshooting`.


(3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of the extendible template files and tags
  *  surround marked blocks with statements
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  generate/remove multiline comments
  *  picking up prototypes
  *  C/C++ dictionaries for keyword completion
  *  (re)moving the root menu

Actions differ for different modes. Please read the documentation:

      :help csupport

Any problems? See the TROUBLESHOOTING section at the end of the help file
`doc/csupport.txt`.

RELEASE NOTES
================================================================================

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 6.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The templates which are inserted into new files as file skeletons can be
  specified in the templates library, via properties:
    `C::FileSkeleton::Header`, `Cpp::FileSkeleton::Header`,
    `C::FileSkeleton::Source`, `Cpp::FileSkeleton::Source`
- Fix a problem with the path when setting `Run->executable to run`.
- New and reworked templates. Change statement templates.

Note: The filetype plug-ins have been moved, and are thus not loaded
automatically anymore. Copy them from `c-support/rc` to `ftplugin`,
or add the commands there to your own filetype plug-ins.

Note: Some configuration for `*.i`, `*.ii`, and quickfix files has been removed.
See `c-support/rc/customization.vimrc` for how to add them to your configuration
files.

Note: This reworks most of the statement templates. The loop and if templates
which do not introduce a block have been remove entirely, since the templates
without blocks save barely any typing. They do not make much sense in visual
mode either. Removing them allows us to clean up the menu and use more consistent
maps.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), the greatest of the German poets,
about LINUX, Vim/gVim and other great tools (Ok, almost.) :

    Muß auf das beste Werkzeug halten.       Must choose the fittest instrument.
